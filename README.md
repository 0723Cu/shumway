## Overview

Shumway is an HTML5 technology experiment that explores building a faithful
and efficient renderer for the SWF file format without native code
assistance.

Shumway is community-driven and supported by Mozilla. Our goal is to
create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for parsing and
rendering SWFs. Integration with Firefox is a possibility if the experiment
proves successful.
